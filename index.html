    <h2>History of Free Fire</h2>
    <p>
      Free Fire is a popular battle royale game developed by 111 Dots Studio and published by Garena. 
      It was officially released on December 4, 2017 for Android and iOS platforms.
      The game quickly became famous due to its lightweight size, making it accessible to 
      players with low-end smartphones. In Free Fire, 50 players are dropped onto an island 
      and must fight to survive, with the last person or team standing declared the winner.
      One of the keys to Free Fire's success is its fast-paced gameplay, with matches 
      lasting about 10 minutes, and the customizable characters that each have unique skills. 
      Garena also regularly adds new content, events, skins, and collaborations with celebrities 
      and brands to keep the game fresh.
      In 2019, Free Fire became the most downloaded mobile game globally, and it has maintained 
      a strong player base, especially in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and India.
      Today, Free Fire has evolved with improved graphics through the launch of Free Fire MAX 
      and remains one of the leading mobile games in the battle royale genre.

   <h3>History of PUBG Mobile</h3>
   <p>
     PUBG Mobile is the mobile adaptation of the hit battle royale game PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG), originally developed by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of Bluehole Studio in South Korea. The original version was released for PC in March 2017, pioneering the modern battle royale genre.
Due to its global success, a mobile version was developed by Tencent Games, a Chinese tech giant, in collaboration with PUBG Corporation. PUBG Mobile was officially released on March 19, 2018, for both Android and iOS devices.
The game retains the same core gameplay as the PC/console version: 100 players are dropped onto an island, and they must scavenge for weapons and fight to be the last person (or team) standing. Matches can be played solo, in duos, or in squads.
PUBG Mobile quickly became one of the most downloaded and highest-grossing mobile games worldwide. Its popularity soared in regions like India, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America.
To improve graphics and gameplay, PUBG Mobile Lite was introduced for lower-end devices, and PUBG: New State was later launched with futuristic elements.
